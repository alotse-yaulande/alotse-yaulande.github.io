Introduction to CNNs","text":"<p>What is a CNN? A Convolutional Neural Network is a type of deep neural network specifically designed to process structured grid-like data, such as images. Unlike traditional feed-forward neural networks, CNNs leverage the spatial structure of data, using small filters (or kernels) that slide over the input to detect local patterns.</p> <p>Why Convolutional Networks? - They use far fewer parameters than fully connected networks, making them more efficient and effective at image tasks. - They are translation-invariant: detecting a feature in one part of the image is useful elsewhere. - They\u2019ve set records in image classification, detection, and various computer vision tasks.</p> <p>Typical Use Cases: - Image Classification (e.g., identifying objects in images) - Object Detection (e.g., locating objects within an image) - Image Segmentation (e.g., classifying each pixel into categories) - Medical Imaging (e.g., identifying tumors in MRI scans)</p> <p>Illustration (Figure 1): Imagine a 2D image of a cat. A CNN \u201clooks\u201d at small patches of the image (e.g., a 3x3 pixel region) to detect features like edges, corners, and simple textures.

Key Concepts in CNNs","text":"<p>The Convolution Operation: A convolution involves taking a small filter (e.g., 3x3 matrix of weights) and sliding it over the input image. At each position, you multiply the filter values by the corresponding pixel values and sum them up, creating a single output number. This process transforms the original image into a set of \u201cfeature maps\u201d that highlight certain characteristics (edges, textures, etc.).</p> <p>Filters (Kernels): A filter is a small matrix of learnable weights. Each filter is trained to recognize a specific pattern. Early layers might learn filters that detect edges, while deeper layers learn more complex patterns.</p> <p>Stride and Padding: - Stride: How many pixels you move the filter each time. A stride of 1 moves one pixel at a time; a stride of 2 moves two pixels at a time, reducing output size. - Padding: Adding zeros around the input so that the output size can remain consistent. Padding ensures that edge features are equally considered.</p> <p>Receptive Field: The receptive field is the region of the input image that a particular output neuron \u201csees.\u201d Deeper neurons have larger receptive fields, allowing them to capture more complex patterns.</p> <p>Feature Maps and Activation Maps: After applying filters and activations, you get feature maps\u2014these represent the presence or absence of certain features detected by filters.</p> <p>Pooling Layers: Pooling reduces the spatial size of the feature maps, typically using max pooling (selecting the maximum value in a small window) or average pooling. This makes the representation more compact and reduces computation.</p> <p>Illustration (Figure 2): - Show an input image (e.g., a 7x7 pixel grayscale image). - A 3x3 filter slides over the image with stride 1. - At each position, the dot product is computed, forming a 5x5 feature map.</p>","tags":["Deep Learning","Computer Vision","CNNs","Python","TensorFlow"]},{"location":"blog/nlp/2024/12/06/Understanding-Convolution-Neural-Network/#3-cnn-architecture-a-layer-by-layer-walkthrough","title":"3.
