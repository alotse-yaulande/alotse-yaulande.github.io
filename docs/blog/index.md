# Introduction to Deep Learning Architectures
Deep learning architectures have evolved significantly over the years. Let's explore some of the most influential architectures and their implementations.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs have revolutionized computer vision tasks. Here's a simple implementation using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 10)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = torch.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = torch.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = torch.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x
```

## Transformers

Transformers have become the go-to architecture for NLP tasks. Here's the key attention mechanism:

```typescript
function attention(query: Tensor, key: Tensor, value: Tensor) {
  const scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))
  const scaledScores = scores / Math.sqrt(key.size(-1))
  const weights = torch.softmax(scaledScores, dim=-1)
  return torch.matmul(weights, value)
}
```

## Future Directions

The field continues to evolve with architectures like:

1. Vision Transformers (ViT)
2. Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
3. Mixture of Experts (MoE)

Stay tuned for detailed implementations of these architectures!
